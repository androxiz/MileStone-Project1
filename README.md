# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first Python milestone project — a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The implementation **does not use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**. It is a two-player game that runs in the console.

## 📋 Description
* The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid.
* **Numpad controls** are used for making moves:
  * Each number corresponds to a specific position on the board.
  * For example, 1 is the bottom-left corner, 5 is the center, and 9 is the top-right corner.
* The script uses the random library to randomly decide which player goes first.
* After each game, players can choose to play again or exit.

## 🚀 Features
* **Team Selection (X or O)**: The first player selects their marker. The second player automatically gets the other marker.
* **Random Turn Order**: The first player is chosen randomly.
* **Console Clearing**: The console is cleared after each move for better readability.
* **Win Condition Check**: The script checks for winning combinations after every move.
* **Restart Option**: At the end of the game, players can choose to replay or exit.
